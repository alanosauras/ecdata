    <h4>About:</h4>
         <h4>This analysis of EC finishes started as a way to look at how the Class 4 boats stacked up against one another and snowballed from there. There is some additional functionality available here for example the ability to search for the fastest "Kruger Seawind" finishes across all years or compare all "Kruger" boats together, or to quickly lookup all the challenges that a specific triber has entered. This data includes Everglades Challenges only and not any UFC stage 1 finishes yet which count an an EC finish. Alligator tooth finishes (those who completed the wilderness waterway) are also not identified in this data yet while they are on the watertribe record book. All the data displayed here is copy pasted directly from the public roster and results pages from watertribe.com. Links below.

    <h4>Missing Boat Data:</h4>
    <h4>   
        The boat data is slightly incomplete since I was unable to standardize all the boat descriptions from the roster into identifiable boats. This is a manual process converting entries like "Yellow TI" and "Hobie Tandem Island" into the same boat type. Boat descriptions like, "very pretty" or "a big one" or "top secret" are impossible to equate to an actual boat type without further research. These entries have a question mark on the boat data table. If you search your tribe name and see that your boat type is not identified shoot me a message and i'll correct it.

<h4>Don't forget about the Original Cp1 Change:</h4>
            
<h4>After 2012, the location of CP1 changed to Cape Haze Marina and no longer required class 4 boats to un-step their masts to get under a low bridge to get to the original CP1 at Grand Tours. This change led to the use of much larger boats, more complicated rigs and also reduced the length of the course slightly.
