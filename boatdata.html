<h4> Below are all unique boat types in order of their number of finshes. Did not starts are not included in attempts.</h4>

<h4> In an attempt to rate the boats from the data a "weighted score" is calculated using a 50/50 weighted average of the number of unique crews for each boat as well as it's success rate. This highlights boats that have a good success rate accross multiple unique crews rather than just one hotshot crew that use the same boat every year. When Sorting by this weighted score, boats with less than 2 unique crews are not shown since data with that few points has little meaning. </h4>
